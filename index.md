The NYU Medical Foundation Model Program is building the artificial intelligence (AI) core of 21st century healthcare through foundation models. We envision a world where large language models and other foundation models will serve as the AI core of healthcare that will assist in every aspect of medical care from the clinical care of health systems, to the operations of insurers, to the research and development of pharmaceutical companies, and even in the daily lives of patients through mobile devices.
